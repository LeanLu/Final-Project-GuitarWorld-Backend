## ðŸ’¾ **Backend** ðŸ’½

### **Description:**

Backend of a guitars e-commerce project.
Users are required to register and log in to use the application.
Once logged in, they can view all the guitars, filter them by categories, add or remove them from their shopping cart and view the guitar details on a specific page.
There is an Admin role which can create, edit and delete the guitars.

The project was developed using [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/es/) with the [Express](https://expressjs.com/) framework and [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).
The database used was [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) with [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/) library.
Unit tests were performed using [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) and integration tests were conducted with [Supertest](https://github.com/ladjs/supertest).
Additionally, [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) was used for functional testing as well and [Render](https://render.com/) to deploy the backend.
